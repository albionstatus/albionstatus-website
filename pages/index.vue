        AlbionStatus is your <span class="text-black">reliable</span> Albion Online server status tracker! Operating
        since <span class="text-black font-semibold">{{ $options.luxonDate }}</span> it was the
        first Albion Online server status tracker ever! Want to know if Albion is
        down? We got you covered.

        The project was created when no server status page was available and the Albion Online
        developers announced the server status changes manually. Additionally, there were heavy DDoS attacks taking down
        the servers every now and then. Nowadays, the most common downtime source is the
        <NuxtLink class="underline hover:no-underline inline-block text-black my-2 md:my-0" to="/daily-maintenance/">
          daily maintenance
        </NuxtLink>.

        AlbionStatus was built to allow players to stay informed about the Albion Online server status while pursuing other
        activities, like watching videos or playing other MMORPGs. The key goal was to make
        refreshing the server status page and client obsolete, and I'm quite sure that we've reached it!<br><br>
