To find out about recent outages, past [maintenance periods](/daily-maintenance/) or possible server errors, we have
created dynamic uptime charts.
The current stacked bar chart shows the uptime of the Albion servers from the last 24 hours grouped by the hour.
The times are displayed in server time, which is UTC. Don't forget to convert them to your local timezone.


AlbionStatus is usually tracking the server status once every minute. In case AlbionStatus could not retrieve the
Albion server status, e.g. because AlbionStatus itself is in maintenance mode, the minutes are shown as
*not tracked* in the uptime chart below.
