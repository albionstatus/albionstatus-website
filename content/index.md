AlbionStatus is your reliable Albion Online server status tracker!
Operating since **<operating-since></operating-since>** it was the first Albion Online server status tracker ever!
Want to know if Albion is down? We got you covered.

The project has been created when no server status page was available, and the Albion Online developers announced the server
status changes manually. Additionally, there were heavy DDoS attacks taking down the servers every now and then.
Nowadays, the most common downtime source is the [daily maintenance](/daily-maintenance/).

AlbionStatus was built to allow players to stay informed about the Albion Online server status while pursuing other activities,
like watching videos or playing other MMORPGs. The key goal was to make refreshing the server status page and client obsolete,
and I'm quite sure we've reached it!  

We also have a [<span class="text-blue-500">Twitter</span>-bot](https://twitter.com/AlbionStatus) which you can follow to
stay up to date about the server status.
Be sure to take a look into the FAQ if you haven't done that by now!

Also, AlbionStatus is the first open source tracker for the servers of Albion Online.
